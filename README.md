# Project Name: Role-based Access Management System

## Overview

This project is a **Role-based Access Management System** designed to manage different levels of access and permissions for users. The system supports three types of users:

- **Admin**
- **Staff**
- **Customer**

Each user role has different levels of permissions and access to system features.

## Features

- **Admin**: Full access to all features, including managing staff, customers, and the overall system configuration.
- **Staff**: Access to moderate system features, manage customer accounts, and assist with tasks within the system.
- **Customer**: Access to personal data, make requests, and interact with the system's customer-facing features.

## User Roles and Permissions

### 1. **Admin**
- Full system control with permissions to:
  - Add, edit, and remove staff and customer accounts.
  - Modify system settings and configurations.
  - Access all data and logs.
  - Manage and assign roles to users.

### 2. **Staff**
- Limited access to the system with permissions to:
  - View and manage customer accounts.
  - Assist customers with their needs.
  - Access only certain areas of the system based on admin settings.
  - No permissions to modify system-wide settings.

### 3. **Customer**
- Access to personal information and specific customer-related services:
  - View personal profile and data.
  - Make requests and communicate with staff.
  - Cannot access system-wide settings or other users' data.

### Managing Rights on GitHub for Admin, Staff, and Customer

When managing permissions in GitHub, these roles correspond to different levels of repository access:

1. **Admin**: GitHub admins have full control over the repository, including changing settings, managing teams, and adding collaborators.
2. **Staff**: Staff members may be given "Write" access, which allows them to push code to branches and create pull requests.
3. **Customer**: On GitHub, customers would typically be external contributors or users. They can be given "Read" access to view the repository but not make changes unless they fork the repository and submit pull requests.

To manage these permissions:

- Go to your repository settings.
- Under the **"Manage access"** section, you can add collaborators or teams.
- Assign them the appropriate permissions: **Admin**, **Write**, or **Read**.

### Example Role Assignment on GitHub

- **Admin**: Can manage access, repository settings, and configurations.
- **Staff**: May have write access to the code and issues.
- **Customer**: View the project, report issues, but not interact with code directly unless contributing via pull requests.

This way, your `README.md` serves both as a guide for users of the project and as a high-level overview of how roles interact with the system.
